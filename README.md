# HourCache
## Prologue: ##
The sun is bright and magnificent. It quite literally sustains all life on Earth. Yet spread thin, its rays offer little direct use to humans. Sure, they aid with Vitamin D, Circadian rhythm, and lifting spirits, but only when focused do they gain serious workable power. Pull out a magnifying glass on a sunny day and you can generate substantial heat, boil water, and even behold fire.

It is no secret that, much like the sun’s rays, we humans are far more powerful when focused. Research, experience, and common sense all indicate that when time and energy are sharply devoted to a task—rather than scattered around listlessly—it infallibly gets completed with unrivaled speed and quality.

Focus, being as vital as it is, has unsurprisingly come under siege in the Age of Information. Attention is practically commoditized by tech giants like Facebook and Tik Tok. The driving metric for a modern advertisement is how long it stays in your head. Clickbait is nearly indistinguishable from content. Almost every day the forecast calls for a storm of headlines, notifications, messages, and countless other distractions. And all of this is compounded by the online environment of the Covid-19 pandemic. The odds certainly seem stacked against you, at least until you wield a weapon of defense.

## Introducing the HourCache: ## 
A user-friendly productivity tool that intuitively tracks where your hours are going! When placed on a particular side, the cube-shaped embedded system records your time spent on a corresponding, user-defined activity. This data is then synthesized and can be reviewed on our website. While the HourCache is rather simple in concept, it offers a powerful framework for time management if used diligently. It is no silver bullet, but to those who take seriously the daily challenge of keeping their concentration intact, the HourCache can offer a hand.
